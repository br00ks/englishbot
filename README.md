# EnglishBot
EnglishBot is an Android prototype to practice English with. Its main component is a conversational agent based on Rasa. 

## Frontend (Android)
Frontend was developed in Android. To install on device, start Android Studio and edit the file `Constants.java`.
To make application work on your phone, the IP-address needs to be set to the IP address of the server (or laptop, when it runs locally). If application runs locally, it is important, that client and server are in the same network, otherwise it won't work. Alternative: use [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/), which exposes your local server.

Note: this is only for testing purposes!

## Backend (Rasa)
The backend is based on the open source machine learning framework [Rasa](https://rasa.com).
